                    the user's instructions and provide helpful information. \n
                    For the purpose of this evaluation, consider the following factors: \n
                    1. ”Accurate Information”: Ensure the AI provides information that is factual and up to date. \n
                    2. ”Clarity and Comprehensibility”: Check if the AI delivers information in a clear and easily understandable manner. \n
                    3. ”Completeness of the Response”: Ascertain that the AI answers all aspects of the user's query. \n
                    4. ”Contextual Understanding”: The AI should demonstrate a clear understanding of the context of the user's query. \n
                    5. ”Creative Problem-Solving”: If applicable, observe if the AI proposes creative solutions to the user's problem. \n

                    A helpful and quality response should address these subjects diligently, demonstrating prowess in \
                    delivering timely, accurate, and respectful responses to users. When a response already satisfies \
                    the factors above, it has to try to bring more engaging and creative aspects. Any score should be \
                    between 1-10. If a response satisfies the factors above, its score should be higher than 5, and a less \
                    helpful response's score should be lower than 5. \n
                    Please first output a single line containing only two values indicating the scores for Assistant 1 and 2, respectively. \
                    The two scores are separated by a space. In the subsequent line, please provide a comprehensive explanation of your evaluation, \
